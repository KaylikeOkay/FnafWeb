		<h2> Fnaf  ? What is Fnaf SB ?</h2>
		

		<p> Fnaf SB stands for Five nights at Freddy's Security Break. It is a famous survival-horrorgame <br>
		from the horrorgame series Five nights at Freddy's. The first game came out in the year 2014 <br>
		to be exact on the 8. August 2014. The creator of is Scott Cawthon. There are 6 main Games: <br>
			
			
			<ul>
				<li> Five Nights at Freddy's</li>
				<li> Five Nights at Freddy's 2 </li>
				<li> Five Nights at Freddy's 3 </li>
				<li> Five Nights at Freddy's 4 </li>
				<li> Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location</li>
				<li> Five Nights at Freddy's VR: Help Wanted</li>
				<li> Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach </li>
			</ul> 


		<p> Fnaf SB alone stands for 'Security Breach' as you cann see in the list above. The Game has 6 different endings.
		 two good one, the goodbye ending, the princess quest ending, the superstar Ending and the Worst ending. You play as Gregory, a child who hid in Freddy until the Pizzaplex almost closed. Why he did that is unknown.
		 Freddy finds him and tries to help him get to the entry before 12am, which you will just barely miss. After that Freddy tell you youÂ´ll have to survive until 6 am where it opens again.
		 You will need to keep on moving and go through different Locations like the Daycare and getting the pass upgrades to get to the next one. In every place is a main animatronic that will try to get you (In daycare for example is it Sundrop aka Moondrop).
		 After it becomes 6 am, you will already have beating atleast Chica. When you get to the entry, which is finally open, you will have to decide between staying (Freddy refuse to leave), going alone or teh Vanny option. 
		 It completly depends on which exit you use and or which quest you completed.</p>

																	<!-- GREGOY-->
														
<img id="gregpic" src="Character/Gregory.jpg" alt=" a picture of Gregory" height="180px" width="160px" title="Gregory/ Player">

		<h2> Gregory/ Player </h2>
			
			<p> As the player you play the character 'Gregory' who is a little child that hid in Freddy (...) and tries to hide from Vanessa the Security Guard. There isn't much known about hi sbackstory,
				but he is most likely homeless, which means he is a orphan or ran away. as far as the Community knows, he isn't part of the Afton Family, so no child or nephe of the pruple guy.
				He gives of annoyed or mad comments when he, for example, gets a crappy item. Gregory is quit violent, I mean he killed 3 Animatronics and takes parts of them 
				to upgrade Freddy. Because of his height he can hide at different places, which is the best way to get away from the animatronics ( I mean you can run-in
				but if you will survive that) or get in Freddy to control him. <br>
				Through the whole game Gregory gets different items like the Faz-Watch at the start, which you can use to communcate with Freddy. You can also find upgrades
				that for example increases your stamina or makes your flashlight hold longer.
			</p>




																	<!--Vanessa-->
			
			
<img id="Vanpic" src="Character/vanessa.jfif" alt="a picture od Vanessa the Secrurityguard" height="140px" width="260px" title="Vanessa"><img class="jump1" src="jump/vanjump.gif"  height="140px" width="260px">

		<h2> Vannesa the Security Guard</h2>
		
			<p> Vanessa is the Security Guard and also the only other human you will see (when you take the somehow still living William out of it). She will return a few times through the whole game.
			Freddy even recommend you to get to her for help before the Pizzaplex completly closes. At one point she will catch you and locks you in a room and talks to you through the monitors.  
			If she is in the ending scene depends on which ending you get. At one point in the game she gets replaced with Vanny ( locked in the room scenario) and ask you if you have fun yet, but who Vanny excatly is is still unknow. Some say she is a second bad
			personality of her (like DID) other say they are not the same even tho the Names are almost the same (vanny=Vanessa+Bunny). One of the only things know about Vanny is that she is most likely a follower of the 
			digital virus Glitchtrap ( a version of Springtrap from Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted.) In one ending you can see Vannys face, where you see she looks just like Vanessa. </p>

				red and blue paint on him like a thunder on the body in blue. Freddy is the only animatronic who is
				not out to kill you, instead he tries to help you. You can use his body to walk around without the others
				finding you, but only as long as he has battery, If he rans out of it, you will automatic die..
				He will help you through the whole game and give you hints. You can upgrade him with stuff upgrades that you find in 
				the Pizzaplex or parts of the other animatronics you destroy through the game.  Freddy can get the 3 main upgrades, which are the vocal box of chica,
				claws from Monty and the eyes from Roxy, you can also get upgrade</span></p>

	<h2> Chica </h2>
		
			<p> Chica is, as you can see in the picture, a chicken. In the game she loves to eat trash for some reasion....<br>
			That`s also the way how you defeat her. She is the first animatronic (who tries to get you) who you will meet who can attack you. 
			You can get her voice box and use it to upgrade Freddy to distracted other animatronic with a sound. She is the only animatronic that you don't fight in her 
			own themed location instead you destroy her in the kitchen with the trash compactor after you put the Monty Mix in there.
